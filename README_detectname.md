- Provides detailed detection results and database matches

### Webcam Mode
```
Enter camera index (default 1): 1
```
- Real-time card detection with visual feedback
- Configurable detection intervals
- Automatic card name extraction and database matching

## Configuration

### Detection Parameters
The script includes several configurable parameters for fine-tuning:

```python
# Card detection thresholds
area_lower = 0.15      # Minimum card area as fraction of image
area_upper = 0.35      # Maximum card area as fraction of image
aspect_low = 0.65      # Minimum aspect ratio (width/height)
aspect_high = 0.78     # Maximum aspect ratio

# Detection intervals
detection_interval = 0.5  # Seconds between detections
debounce_seconds = 2.0    # Minimum time between same card detections
```

### OCR Settings
```python
# Text processing thresholds
similarity_threshold = 0.6  # Minimum similarity for fuzzy matching
min_text_length = 4        # Minimum detected text length
```

## Output

### Detection Results
- **Card Names**: Extracted and corrected card names
- **Database Matches**: Top matches from MTG card database
- **Confidence Scores**: Similarity percentages for matches
- **Visual Feedback**: Detection overlays and preview images

### File Outputs
- `card_detection_debug.png`: Debug visualization of detected cards
- `products.json`: Processed card data for inventory management

## Advanced Features

### OBS Virtual Camera Support
The script includes special support for OBS Studio virtual cameras:
- Automatic detection of OBS Virtual Camera
- Optimized settings for virtual camera feeds
- Detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting

### Multi-Card Detection
- Detects multiple cards in a single image
- Handles overlapping and partially visible cards
- Provides individual processing for each detected card

### Error Handling
- Robust error handling for camera failures
- Graceful degradation when OCR fails
- Detailed error messages and troubleshooting suggestions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Detected
1. Run "Test Camera Connection" mode
2. Check camera permissions in Windows
3. Try different camera indices (0, 1, 2, etc.)
4. Test with Windows Camera app first

#### Poor Detection Accuracy
1. Ensure good lighting conditions
2. Position cards clearly within the detection border
3. Avoid glare and shadows on card surfaces
4. Use higher resolution camera settings

#### OCR Errors
1. Check that cards are clearly visible
2. Ensure card names are not obscured
3. Try different card angles and positions
4. Verify `mtg_cards_data.json` is present and valid

### Performance Optimization
- Use 1280x720 resolution for best performance
- Close other camera applications
- Ensure adequate lighting
- Position cards within the detection border

## Integration
