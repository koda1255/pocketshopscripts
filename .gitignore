# Ignore Composer's vendor directory. Run `composer install` to get these.

# NOTE: It is recommended to COMMIT your `composer.lock` file for plugins.
# This ensures all developers and servers use the exact same dependency versions.
# If this were a library, you would typically ignore it.

# Ignore configuration files from popular editors.
.idea/
.vscode/
*.sublime-project

# If you are developing inside a full server directory, these lines
# will prevent you from committing the entire server.
